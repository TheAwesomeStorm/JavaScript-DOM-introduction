# Introduction To DOM (Document Object Model)

This project was created to reiforce the learnings I got with the Alura course named **JS na Web: Manipule o DOM com JavaScript**

The HTML and CSS was given at the start of the course and the JavaScript was coded from scratch

You can check out the final project [here](https://theawesomestorm.github.io/Introduction-to-DOM/)
