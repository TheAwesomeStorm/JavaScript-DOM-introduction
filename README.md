# Introduction To DOM (Document Object Model)

This project was created to reiforce the learnings I got with the Alura course named **JS na Web: Manipule o DOM com JavaScript**

The project simulates a house task list manager, where the user is able to include and remove tasks, and also marking those as concluded

The HTML and CSS was given at the start of the course and the JavaScript was coded from scratch

You can check out the final project [here](https://theawesomestorm.github.io/JavaScript-DOM-introduction/)
